            <p>Hello there, welcome to my personal page. A little something about me is that half of my family is here in the US 
            & the rest are located in Mexico. I have 2 cats (I'm a stepdad to one) & 2 annoyingly small dogs. Currently, I'm working at a global Japanese/German company known as DMG MORI.
            I love watcing basketball and football (not soccer!) wiht a passion. One of my wishes is to finally be able to purchase season tickets for either sport.</p>

            <p>I never lived in California my entire life, I actually took a gamble and moved out to Seattle, WA for a change of scenery and greatly enjoyed my time there;
             who knows, I might go back again one day. Only after moving back it occured to me that you shouldn't stay in one place you're entire life. You're losing out on an opportunity to go out & explore the unknown.</p>
